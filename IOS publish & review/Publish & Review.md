When IPA is already in local, but did not upload to Itunes Connect before:

Xcode--> Open Developer Tool --> Application Loader

Deliver Your app.



Another way is to use the normal build process to upload.



After you upload the IPA.

You need to go to the Itunes connect:

Under "App Store" ---> 版本或平台 (version or platform)  －－》 input the version nubmer you uploaded before
