#Background App Refresh

Background App Refresh is a new feature added to iOS 7. What it does is allows apps to quietly wake up and download content all while in the background.

Some of the built in Apple apps such as Mail, Contacts and the Calendar have always done this. When a new email arrives, you open the app and the email is there. Likewise, you add a contact on a remote device and it is automatically added to your contact list on your iPhone. On the other hand, all 3rd party apps could not do this. When notifications of a new email arrive, you open the app and then need to wait for syncronisation to happen. The same happens with apps like Evernote where your new notes are not downloaded until you open the app and sync it.
