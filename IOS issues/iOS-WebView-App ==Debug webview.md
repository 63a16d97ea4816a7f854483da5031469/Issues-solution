#iOS-WebView-App ==Debug

Simple iOS app that loads a web page created to ease debugging a uiWebView.

Unfortunately you cannot directly debug Chrome on iOS as debugging hooks are not available in published apps. This is the next best thing. If your issue reproduces the same in Mobile Safari, you can debug there. It's easier.

You'll need to install XCode.
