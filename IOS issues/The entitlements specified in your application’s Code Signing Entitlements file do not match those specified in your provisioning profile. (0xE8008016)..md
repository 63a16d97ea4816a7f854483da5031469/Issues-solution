#The entitlements specified in your applicationâ€™s Code Signing Entitlements file do not match those specified in your provisioning profile. (0xE8008016).

Solution:
What worked for me was to completely delete the entitlements file, from the groups list, and from the Build Settings in both Project and Target. Then I recreated the entitlements from the Summary tab in the target, and it loaded fine without any error messages.
