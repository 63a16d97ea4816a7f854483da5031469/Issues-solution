#Xcode error “Could not find Developer Disk Image”

	
This was the solution for me - just updated to iOS 9.3 today and Xcode stopped working until I updated.

For people who would have similar problems in the future, beware that this problem is fundamentally rooted in the mismatch of your iOS version and xcode version. Check the compatibility of iOS and xcode.
