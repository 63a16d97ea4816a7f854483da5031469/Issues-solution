#How to select Multiple images from UIImagePickerController


	You have to use custom imagepicker. And I think ELCImagePickerController is the best option in my opinion.
	
	There is also some other library that can be used..
	
	Objective-C
	1. ELCImagePickerController
	2. WSAssetPickerController
	3. QBImagePickerController
	4. ZCImagePickerController
	5. CTAssetsPickerController
	6. AGImagePickerController
	7. UzysAssetsPickerController
	8. MWPhotoBrowser
	9. TSAssetsPickerController
	10. CustomImagePicker
	11. InstagramPhotoPicker
	12. GMImagePicker
	13. DLFPhotosPicker
	14. CombinationPickerController
	15. AssetPicker
	16. BSImagePicker
	17. SNImagePicker
	18. DoImagePickerController
	19. grabKit
	20. IQMediaPickerController
	21. HySideScrollingImagePicker
	22. MultiImageSelector
	23. TTImagePicker
	24. SelectImages
	25. ImageSelectAndSave
	26. imagepicker-multi-select
	27. MultiSelectImagePickerController
	
	Swift
	1. LimPicker (Similar to WhatsApp's image picker) 
	2. RMImagePicker
	3. DKImagePickerController
