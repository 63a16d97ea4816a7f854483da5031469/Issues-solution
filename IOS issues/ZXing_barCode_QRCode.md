ZBar

	ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar
	codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw
	intensity sensors. It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128,
	Code 39, Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.  Included with the
	library are basic applications for decoding captured bar code images and
	using a video device (eg, webcam) as a bar code scanner.  For application
	developers, language bindings are included for C, C++, Python and Perl
	as well as GUI widgets for Qt, GTK and PyGTK.
