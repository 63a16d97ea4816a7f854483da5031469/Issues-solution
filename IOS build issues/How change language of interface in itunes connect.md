##How change language of interface in itunes connect

Found that very frustrating too (I'm Russian too). It based on your "preferred language" settings in browser. If you use Chrome, it can be found there chrome://settings/languages, move "English" upper. That's it.

It is related to the browse settings.

Changing to another browse can solve this issue.
